Looking at the evidence during tear down ESP unit (such as, brittle insulation lamination, darkened oil, discolored rotor sleeves) indicated the ESP run in high temperature environment. It was obviously proven by sensor data that showed TM reached 349 Â°F. 
2. High Motor temperature was caused by several factors, such as : (a) thick layer of scale covered motor housing. (b) Low well flow (based on last data, it was only 126 BFPD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

So, here is the sequence of failure :    Low flow + scale -> decreased cooling system -> increased motor temp -> brittle wire magnet plastic protector -> wire  magnet touched each other -> short circuit (generated heat) -> wire burnt -> motor short circuit                                                                                                            ",2019-02-08,2018-08-28,2017-06-14,80.0,147.0,662.0,296.3333333,,,pulled

5. Sensor : No DIFA data.
6. Cable : there were 2 burnt spots found. One spot caused damaged on armor only while another spot had bad effect which caused one of cable phase parted.  From data that is provided, damaged on cable could be caused by jetting effect where the top perforation @5540 ft while the splicing position @5546 ft. This jetting effect was worsen due to the presence of high gas volume on this well.
